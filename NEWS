  The interface has been rearrange into a more natural structure, based
  on DB, Table, Post, Field ... objects instead of just a bunch of
  commonly used procedures. The idea is to be able to handle relations
  and fields in the same way whenever possible and to make it easy to
  add custom Field, Database or Relation objects handling different
  kinds of fields or relation or even database handling routines.

	All the features of the old HTMLView code is still there, plus quite 
  a few new ones (see the docs). As for the previous TODO list what
  I've got into this new stuff is just the following things:

  * Move all Post handling to to HTMLView::Post and use it.

      As I said all methods are now split up into this kind of objects

  * Autodetect the part of $flds that's in $where in HTMLView::ViewList

      Actually the selection code is much more advanced now, you just
      specify the where clause (which might even contains field names
      like 'group->name' to match the name field in a related table
      through the relation group)

  * List methods that might have to be changed if using a different DBD

      Actually they're all placed in a separate DB class which can be
      subclassed and the methods needing changing can be overloaded.

0.3
  * Added HTMLView::ViewData method for simplifying wrting customized 
    viewing scripts.
  * Added example script Formated.cgi for viewing posts in a formated 
    way.
  * Added HTMLView::ViewList method that allows you to simply make complex
    relation based searchings and then disply the result.
0.2
  * Wrote a QuickStart tutorial taking you through the first steps of 
    setting up an database interface.
  * Made sure all the SYNOPSIS code and the View.cgi script runs as they 
    are (that is they contain working example databse names).
  * Corrected some old out of date statements in the docs as reported by 
    Ronald Emaus <Ronald.Emaus@wl.com>.
  * Cleand up the docs
        * Some code cleanup and bugfixes
