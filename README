Description
-----------

This is a general propose module to simplify the creation of web
userinterfaces to a DBI database, currently it can list, view, add,
edit and delete entries in the databse using either <input ...> or
<textarea> to gather the info.

It can also edit N2N relations between two tabels using a third table
to represent the connections.

It's actions is highy customizable by using a database definition 
where most things are specified and by beeing designed to easily 
allow subclassing in order to change it's behaviour.

It is constructed as a set of objects that could be considered 
editors or viewers. Those objects can either be used as they are
or be subclassed if they can be customized enough for your needs.
See the View.cgi example for the simples posible use that gields a 
quite powerfull cgi based editor.

Se the documentation for DBIx::HTMLView for a more detailed 
description and the docs on the sub class to find the properties of
the diffrent editors. There is also a QuickStart tutorial that step 
by step takes you through the creation of a database.

To use this with your databases you need a DBI interface to your 
database. DBI can be found at CPAN together with a driver located 
in DBD.
